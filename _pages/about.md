To accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for sparse optimization, <a style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;color:#015697" href="https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/CSpack" target="_blank">SparseOpt</a> aims to accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for sparse optimization and provides a platform on which users can test a wide range of sparse optimization problems by using the provided solvers and useful tools. Please see <a style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;color:#015697" href="" target="_blank">menu-of-SparseOpt for more details</a>. The current version of this toolbox is made up of four basic tools:  i) a collection of practical tools, ii) both synthetic and real
datasets, and iii) ten solvers tailored for a variety of sparse optimization problems, including compressive sensing, logistic regression, support vector machines, and quadratically constrained quadratic programming, among others.
